# ISP Tester

Test your local network's connection to your gateway, ISP, and Internet locations. Could help getting your ISP to come fix issues at your residence.

## Motivation

I have had a recurring issue with my Comcast Xfinity Internet that I can't seem to fix. I wrote this to run on a Raspberry Pi in my local network continuously, so that I can figure out exactly where the issue is in the network and bring this to my ISP to see if they can help fix it.

## Roadmap

See the associated GitHub project and issues for next steps.
